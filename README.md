# PR Flow State

Can PR reviews be enjoyable?

## The Problem
- What breaks flow in current PR reviews?
  - PRs lack embedded context
  - Review process disconnects from original intent
  - Automated checks overwhelm signal with noise
- Real examples from my experience
  - I often am using repos to try out new things for learning, but without much context when i go to review the PR I end up just ticking boxes. 
- Why this matters for team velocity
  - As AI becomes a co-developer, traditional PR workflows break down even further. Lots of risk of the implementation drifting away from the plan.
  - Keeping going back and forth out of the review pulls me out of flow, so really hard to get into deep work mode and staying in it. Flow breaks → reviews stall → features stall → teams disengage.
- What flow would look like
  - An enjoyable PR review would surface intent first, highlight meaningful changes, and feel like contributing to delivery rather than policing.
  - This repo explores whether we can prototype workflows that make that vision real.
